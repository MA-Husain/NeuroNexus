Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Number Guessing Game" and "To-Do List" projects!

## Number Guessing Game

In the `number-guess-game` folder, I have created a simple number guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input a guess, and the game will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Project Structure

number-guess-game/ <br />
|-- index.html <br />
|-- css/ <br />
|   |-- style.css <br />
|-- js/ <br />
|   |-- script.js <br />


### How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button to see if your guess is correct.
4. Enjoy the game!

## To-Do List

In the `to-do-list` folder, I have implemented a simple to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, and remove tasks to keep track of their activities.

### Project Structure

to-do-list/ <br />
|-- index.html <br />

|   |-- script.js <br />


### How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Add tasks using the input field and "Add" button.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.
4. Hover over a task and use the buttons to edit or delete it.
5. Stay organized with your to-do list!
